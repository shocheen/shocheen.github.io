![Sachin Kumar](/images/dp.jpg){: style="width:200px;" }

I am an Assistant Professor at The Ohio State University. My research interests broadly include topics in Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP). I aim to build language technologies that work well across diverse languages, domains, and user communities.

My current interests include:

* Multilingual models that equitably support written and spoken languages.
* Continual adaptation of NLP models to new languages, varieties, and domains.
* Personalization of language technologies to diverse user preferences.
* Evaluation of language models for real-world scenarios.

These directions span dataset creation, modeling paradigms, training and inference algorithms, and evaluation methodologies.

**I will be recruiting multiple PhD students this cycle (Fall 2025). If you are interested, apply [here](https://cse.osu.edu/prospective-students/graduate/cse-graduate-admissions) and mention my name in your application.**

I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) from August 2023 to August 2024. I obtained my Ph.D. at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in August 2023, spending my final two years visiting the University of Washington in Seattle.

A new version of my personal page is under construction; you can find the current version at [shocheen.com](http://shocheen.com).
