I am an Assistant Professor at The Ohio State University. 

My research interests broadly include topics in Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP). In particular, I am interested in building NLP solutions for real use cases that work for all people; models that can uniformly support diverse languages, domains, populations, and individuals. Some research directions I am currently excited about are: 

* Multilingual models that can equitably support written and spoken languages. 

* Continual adaptation of NLP models to support new languages, varieties, domains, and capabilities. 

* Personalization of language technologies to diverse user preferences.

* Evaluation of language models for scenarios that real users care about. 

These directions touch various parts of a typical machine learning pipeline including building new datasets, modeling paradigms and architectures, training and inference algorithms, and evaluation methodologies. 

**I will be recruiting multiple PhD students this cycle (Fall 2025). If you are interested, apply [here](https://cse.osu.edu/prospective-students/graduate/cse-graduate-admissions) (and mention my name in your application).**

I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) from August 2023-August 2024. I obtained my Ph.D. at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in August 2023 with the final two years of my PhD spent visiting the University of Washington in Seattle.
