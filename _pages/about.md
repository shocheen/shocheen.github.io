I am an Assistant Professor at The Ohio State University. 

My research interests broadly include topics in Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing (NLP). In particular, I am interested in building language technologies that work for all people---language models that can uniformly support diverse languages, domains, populations, and individuals. Some research directions I am currently excited about are: 

* Multilingual models that can equitably support written and spoken languages. 

* Continual adaptation of NLP models to support new languages, varieties, domains, and capabilities. 

* Personalization of language technologies to diverse user preferences.

* Evaluation of language models for scenarios that real users care about (especially interested in uses for experts like scientists and clinicians) 

These directions touch various parts of a typical machine learning pipeline, including building new datasets, modeling paradigms and architectures, training and inference algorithms, and evaluation methodologies. 

I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) and obtained my Ph.D. at the Language Technologies Institute at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) in 2023, with the final two years of my PhD spent visiting the University of Washington in Seattle.
